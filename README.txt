This project focuses on optimizing traffic light control in an urban traffic network using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. 
The goal is to reduce congestion by dynamically adjusting traffic light phases based on real-time traffic conditions.

The project follows a reinforcement learning (RL) approach where an agent learns to optimize traffic signals by interacting with a SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) environment. 
The PPO-LSTM agent selects actions based on historical traffic data and receives rewards based on the average speed of vehicles in the network.
